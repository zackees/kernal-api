# Intel macOS test lane

Executes the `x86_64-apple-darwin` test suite. The suite is **built on Linux**
and only **run on macOS**: a GitHub-hosted Linux runner cross-compiles the
archive through Soldr's own toolchain, then boots a real x86_64 macOS Recovery
guest under QEMU/KVM and replays the archive inside it.

Nothing here needs a `macos-*` runner, a baked guest image, an SSH secret, or a
published GHCR package. `.github/workflows/macos-x64-tests.yml` runs nightly and
on demand, and is advisory — never a required check, never a release gate.

## Pieces

| File | Runs on | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `build-archive.sh` | Linux runner | Cross-build the nextest archive |
| `stage-guest-share.sh` | Linux runner | Stage the archive + Mach-O `cargo-nextest` the guest fetches over HTTP |
| `recovery-guest.sh` | macOS guest | Fetch the archive, run it, write evidence to `/tmp/results` |
| `verify-guest-results.py` | Linux runner | Decide pass/fail and assert Intel coverage from the collected evidence |

The guest half is driven by [`zackees/docker-mac-x64`][action], pinned to a
commit in the workflow. It owns the KVM setup, the disk reclaim, the boot, the
HTTP share at `10.0.2.2:8000`, and the collection of `/tmp/results`.

## Why the guest binary is a downloaded Mach-O

The archive is produced on Linux by `soldr cargo nextest archive`, so the
`cargo-nextest` on the runner's `PATH` is a Linux binary and cannot run in the
guest. `stage-guest-share.sh` therefore reads the version from the same nextest
that built the archive and downloads nextest's published
`universal-apple-darwin` build for that exact version, verifying it against the
release's `.sha256` before it can reach the guest.

nextest owns its archive format, so the guest's nextest is matched to the
builder's rather than pinned to a constant here that could drift.

## Why Recovery, not a prebaked image

This lane previously pulled a hand-baked `dockur/macos` image from this
repository's own GHCR namespace. That image was never published — the
`macos-x64-bake.yml` workflow the old comment named has never existed in this
repository — and producing it required a 30–60 minute manual macOS install plus
a 128 GB volume published by hand. Every run since the workflow landed failed at
`guest.sh start` with `manifest unknown`; the scripts and the Dockerfile for
that approach have been removed rather than left to rot.

A Recovery guest has no toolchain of its own, so the archive must be
self-contained. It is: every fixture these tests read is `include_str!`/
`include_bytes!` and therefore already inside the test binaries.

## What the guest does not run

- **`#[ignore]`d tests** are skipped by nextest by default. That covers every
  test needing a full macOS userland — the Tauri/WKWebView screenshot proofs,
  the threaded-worker containment proofs, and the archive fixtures — none of
  which belong in a Recovery partition.
- **Four source-inspection policy tests** are excluded by name in
  `recovery-guest.sh`: `daemon_frame_v1`, `daemon_identity`, `version_policy`,
  and `facade_policy`. They read this crate's own tree through
  `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`, a compile-time constant still pointing at the
  Linux builder's path, and `--workspace-remap` cannot rewrite a compile-time
  constant. They assert on source text that is identical on every host and
  `rust-native (ubuntu-latest)` already runs them. This mirrors the exclusion
  the aarch64 lane carries in `ci.yml`.

## Coverage assertion

`verify-guest-results.py` fails the job unless the collected log proves the
guest ran **Intel** code. `src/snapshot/unwind.rs`'s `frame_pointer_tests`
module compiles only under `#[cfg(all(test, target_arch = "x86_64"))]`, so
naming those six tests is what distinguishes a real Intel run from a green job
that executed nothing. That failure mode — passing while verifying nothing — is
the one this lane was created to close.

## Local use

The Linux half runs anywhere:

```bash
./build-archive.sh          # ~85 s, produces kernal-x64.tar.zst
./stage-guest-share.sh      # downloads the pinned Mach-O cargo-nextest
```

The guest half needs `/dev/kvm`. On a host that has it, the workflow step is the
only supported entry point — `zackees/docker-mac-x64` is a GitHub Action and its
`run:` input is the guest's one script.
