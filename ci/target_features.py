"""Print the feature list for a kernal-api *target* graph, comma-separated.

    uv run --no-project --python 3.12 ci/target_features.py

That is every feature in Cargo.toml's `[features]` except `default` and the
host-only ones. A host-only feature is a build-script facility: it only ever
runs in an application's `build.rs`, compiled for the build host, so it never
belongs in a graph linked for another target. `build-resources` is one:
`embed-resource` depends on `vswhom-sys` for Windows, whose C++ archive is built
only on a Windows host, so a Linux-hosted cross link of kernal-api's own test
binaries for `*-pc-windows-msvc` fails with undefined `vswhom_*` symbols.

The list is derived rather than hard-coded so a new feature is covered by the
per-target build matrix automatically. Every optional dependency is named by
a `dep:` entry, so there are no implicit features and this list is exactly
`--all-features` minus the host-only set. Host-only features stay covered by
the per-feature isolation check and by `tests/build-resources-consumer`,
which runs `build-resources` as a real build-dependency.
