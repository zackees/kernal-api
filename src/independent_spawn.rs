//! Facade-owned independent resource placement for launched processes.
//!
//! `running-process` is a private backend like Tokio or any other
//! implementation crate: these types mirror its placement contract so callers
//! never name, depend on, or version-lock to a backend type. Conversions stay
//! private to this module, and [`SpawnHandle`] keeps the substrate's live
//! control handle in a private field.
//!
//! [`SpawnMode::Inherited`] is the default and preserves ordinary direct
//! spawning inside the caller's cgroup or Job Object. [`SpawnMode::Independent`]
//! is explicit: it requires a verified native scheduler or a pre-existing
//! broker already outside the caller's boundary. It never silently degrades to
//! inherited placement. Independent placement remains subject to user,
//! container, and machine-wide limits; it is neither privilege elevation nor a
//! container escape.
//!
//! For a persistent build daemon, provide an absolute program/cwd/logging
//! [`LaunchSpec`], select `SpawnMode::Independent` with an
//! [`IndependentBackend`], then retain [`SpawnHandle`] for reuse-safe stop or
//! wait operations. [`SpawnLifetime::Detached`] controls only what dropping that
//! handle does; it is distinct from resource placement. Readiness,
//! cancellation, authority, and unsupported-platform failures propagate as the
//! `std::io::Error` returned by [`spawn_with_options`].
