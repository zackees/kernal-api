//! Verification and control of a recorded daemon process.
//!
//! The substrate's PID verifier lives behind its broker client feature, which
//! would drag argument parsing, configuration, and broker IPC into every
//! direct daemon.  This module owns the same checks over this crate's own
//! host facade instead: host boot, process liveness, executable path, and the
//! executable's BLAKE3 digest.  A successful verification returns a
//! [`VerifiedDaemon`] that keeps the live process reference it was verified
//! through, so later liveness questions and a forced termination address that
//! instance rather than whatever process later reuses its PID.
