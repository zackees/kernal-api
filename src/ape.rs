//! Actually Portable Executable (APE / cosmocc) launch support.
//!
//! A Cosmopolitan APE binary starts with a shell prologue rather than a native
//! image header. A host with no `binfmt_misc` registration for it -- stock
//! NixOS, most containers, macOS -- refuses it with "Exec format error", and
//! only a shell knows to retry.
//!
//! This crate launches such an image through a loader instead
//! (`<loader> <image> <args...>`), chosen by [`plan_launch`]: an explicit
//! loader ([`LOADER_ENV`] or [`ApeOptions::loader`]), else the loader
//! embedded in the image (Linux; installed into a private, exec-capable cache
//! directory or a sealed memfd), else an installed `ape`, else the host
//! shell. The embedded loader needs no `PATH`, `dd`, `gzip` or `$TMPDIR` in
//! the child, so a cleared environment works.
//!
//! Every process this crate spawns gets this automatically:
//! [`SpawnSpec`](crate::SpawnSpec) spawns and sessions and
//! [`run_bounded_command`](crate::run_bounded_command) plan the loader before
//! the spawn, and
//! [`platform::process::spawn_sync`](crate::platform::process::spawn_sync)
//! retries a caller-built command once after a refusal. [`command`] gives a
//! caller that builds its own `std::process::Command` the same plan. On a
//! host that runs APE images natively (Windows) nothing is ever planned.
