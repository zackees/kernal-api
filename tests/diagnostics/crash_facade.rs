//! Consumer-style contract for the crash facade's public surface.
//!
//! This fixture is a separate crate, so it can only reach what a real client
//! can. An in-crate test can name `CrashMetadata` through the private `use`
//! in `crash`, so it cannot notice the type being unreachable from outside.
//!
//! zccache hit exactly that: `kernal_api::crash::install` is the entry point,
//! but naming its argument meant reaching into `crash::spool`.
