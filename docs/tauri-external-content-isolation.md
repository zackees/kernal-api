# External webview isolation

The `tauri-webview` feature is a native desktop capability. It is excluded
from `default` and `full`, and its dependencies are target-scoped so a Wasm
guest target cannot resolve a platform webview runtime.

The private backend creates a plain `tauri_runtime::PendingWindow` on the
canonical `tauri_runtime_wry::Wry` event loop, then attaches a direct
`wry::WebViewBuilder` without calling `with_ipc_handler` or adding custom
schemes. Default opens add no caller scripts. It does not use Tauri's
`WebviewWindowBuilder`, which installs an IPC bridge. The exact published Wry
0.57.0 pin makes bridge installation conditional on that omitted handler on
Windows and macOS. On Linux the adapter removes backend initialization scripts
and unregisters the IPC endpoint before navigation. A loopback proof asserts that
`window.ipc`, Tauri internals, and the platform IPC handler are all absent.
The view is incognito, disables clipboard, autofill, and devtools, refuses
downloads, and denies every popup/new-window request.

Only absolute HTTP(S) URLs with a host are accepted. This includes loopback
HTTP for native tests. `file:`, `data:`, custom schemes, credentials, malformed
URLs are rejected before a window is created; prohibited later navigations are
rejected by the native policy. A
`PageLoadEvent::Finished` only resolves the completion for its matching
requested top-level URL. A user close, failed close, popup, or rejected
navigation completes the owned callback with a typed private reason.

`WebviewUrlGrant::new` validates a URL before effects and bounds both its input
and canonical form to 16 KiB. `open_granted_webview` binds that value to the
client's instance in the same operation/resource hub. Its open borrows the URL
grant; revocation cancels an unfinished open and reclaims the unpublished view.
Cancellation before resource attachment also rolls back both reservations.
`open_webview(&str)` uses this same path, with a temporary grant released on
success, error, or future drop. An already completed view owns its separate
view authority, so releasing the temporary URL grant does not close it.

Wry owns the platform event loop and must be initialized and driven on its UI
thread. Creation uses Wry's supported handle routing from the facade-owned
async runtime's blocking lane; it never blocks the event loop and avoids the
Windows callback-creation deadlock. The backend does not create a Tokio runtime
or another OS runtime. The public `webview` facade owns semantic
`open_webview`, `wait_until_loaded`, terminal observation, and `close`
operations. They share the generated kernel operation/resource hub without
exposing a Tauri/Wry type or inventing a second registry. Timeout,
cancellation, user close, and rejected navigation revoke the resource
generation and wake pending operations with typed facade errors. The current
generated screenshot guest now uses URL-grant/open/load/capture/close
operations through a root-scoped native dispatcher. URL/output grants precede
instantiation and every operation uses the root's original hub and runtime.
See `examples/wasm-tauri-screenshot` for the actual CLI/guest proof and its
remaining tracing, containment, and platform acceptance work. Native-only
smoke tests remain distinct from that end-to-end Wasm proof.

On Linux, renderer environment must be configured by the application launcher,
before starting the process. The safe library constructor does not mutate
process environment: an existing runtime or application thread may already
be reading it. Where needed, launch with `env JSC_useSharedArrayBuffer=1 app`;
on NVIDIA, also supply `__NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC=1`, and for an X11 backend
`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1`. These are launch-time choices, not defaults
that override explicitly supplied user values.

GTK's unknown/fractional font DPI is corrected before each view. Correction
remembers the original desktop setting per GTK settings object on the UI
thread, so repeated views do not divide an already corrected value. Observed
desktop-setting and monitor-scale changes are recomputed from the original;
an external reset exactly equal to the last applied value is indistinguishable.
The repeated-view, scale-change, desktop-change, and unknown-DPI regression
tests failed with the original cumulative division and pass with this state.

`WebviewPermissions` is deny-by-default. Call
`open_webview_with_permissions(url, WebviewPermissions::deny_all().allow_user_media())`
only for pages that should receive microphone/camera access. On Linux this
enables WebKitGTK media streams and accepts only user-media permission
requests; all other WebKit permission kinds remain denied. GStreamer core,
base, good, and PipeWire plugins must be available to WebKitGTK for devices to
enumerate (notably, an unwrapped Nix shell may need to expose them).

For a repeatable Linux proof outside CI, use the Nix development shell below.
The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` derivation is necessary when launching a Soldr-built
binary from the ephemeral shell rather than from a Nix-wrapped derivation:

```sh
nix-shell -p pkg-config gtk3 webkitgtk_4_1 xorg-server xauth xvfb-run --run 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(printf "%s" "$NIX_LDFLAGS" | tr " " "\n" | sed -n "s/^-L//p" | paste -sd:); export LD_LIBRARY_PATH; GDK_BACKEND=x11 xvfb-run -a soldr --jobs 2 cargo run --locked --features tauri-webview-test-support --bin kernal-tauri-smoke -j 1 -- close'
```

Replace `close` with `widget`, `bootstrap`, `popup`, `redirect`, `timeout`, `cancel`,
`window-close`, `capture`, `capture-cancel`, or `open-cancel` to exercise
isolation and cleanup paths. The test-support feature is accepted only for
this executable proof and exposes aggregate semantic counts, never backend
types.

The existing `tauri-webview-smoke` CI job runs both capture scenarios and the
ignored live WebKitGTK image test explicitly. `capture` verifies the opaque
snapshot service, bounded reads, typed pixel/byte failures, and final cleanup.
`capture-cancel` pauses native UI dispatch, abandons four requests, verifies
the fifth is rejected while native admission remains held, and then drains
the queue. `open-cancel` abandons an open while UI dispatch is paused and
requires the reserved operation and resource counts to return immediately
to their pre-open baseline. Before the reservation guard, this real Linux
runner failed with two resources and two pending operations instead of one
of each; the guard now releases that semantic authority on future drop.
It separately waits for native creation admission to drain after releasing
the paused UI. This does not establish every native destruction race on
every platform. Creation admission, like capture admission, is held through
the native callback even after semantic cancellation consumes the operation.
The live image test separately decodes PNG pixels and verifies
viewport dimensions and fixture colors. These Linux gates do not establish
the still-required Windows/macOS runtime proofs or the generated Wasm sketch.
See [adapter ownership and remaining evidence](viewport-capture-adapters.md).

## Explicit page bootstrap

Native callers may opt into `open_webview_with_bootstrap` using a validated
`WebviewPageBootstrap`. Its trusted source is limited to 64 KiB of UTF-8 and
cannot contain NUL. The limit bounds stored source, not execution time or page
allocations. JavaScript runs at document start in the ordinary page world;
syntax errors use normal page error reporting rather than becoming open errors.
It is not a native IPC capability and must not contain secrets or untrusted
remote input interpolated as code.

Bootstrap views restrict navigation to the initial HTTP(S) origin. Both the
native policy and a main-frame/origin JavaScript guard apply; the latter is
necessary because WebView2 can inject initialization scripts into subframes.
The script runs again on same-origin reloads. Default script-free opens retain
their existing navigation policy.

Run the `bootstrap` smoke scenario to verify execution before the first page
script, re-execution on reload, absence in a same-origin child frame, absence
of the tested IPC bridges, and rejection of cross-origin navigation. The HTTP
fixture permits automatic favicon requests without counting them as an expected
page request; it still rejects other unexpected paths. The fixture regression
tests that distinction independently of native browser scheduling.

## Widget window controls (#384)

`WebviewWindowOptions` records five presentation requests besides title and
size. They are plain values and have no native effect until an open; the
title and size bounds still apply. None of them adds script, navigation, or
IPC authority, and the loopback no-IPC proof runs with all of them enabled.

```rust
let host = ExternalWebviewHost::with_app_id(runtime.handle(), "dev.bosn.widget")?;
let views = host.client();
let options = WebviewWindowOptions::new("bosn", 72, 72)?
    .initial_position(1820, 980)?
    .decorations(false)
    .transparent(true)
    .always_on_top(true)
    .skip_taskbar(true);
let support = views.window_support(); // what this display honours
```

`ExternalWebviewHost::with_app_id` validates the id before any native effect:
1 to 128 bytes of `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, at least two dot-separated elements, none
empty and none starting with a digit. The element rule is GLib's (GTK refuses
any other id, and tao would panic on it); the 128-byte bound is the Windows
AppUserModelID limit. One rule applies on every host, with
`WindowOptionsError::InvalidAppId` for anything else.
`initial_position(x, y)` takes logical coordinates of the outer top-left
corner, each -32768 through 32767, and returns
`WindowOptionsError::InvalidPosition` otherwise.

### Best-effort controls report honestly

Placement, keep-above and taskbar exclusion are best effort.
`ExternalWebviewClient::window_support()` returns a `WebviewWindowSupport`
with one `BestEffort` per control, decided once on the UI thread when the
host starts:

- `BestEffort::Requested`: the request reaches the window system (X11,
  Windows, macOS). An X11 window manager can still adjust it.
- `BestEffort::Unsupported`: the display is Wayland (GDK reports a
  `GdkWaylandDisplay`). xdg-shell gives a client no say in position or
  stacking, and KWin, Mutter and wlroots ignore GTK's keep-above and
  skip-taskbar hints, so the facade does not pretend. An unsupported initial
  position is not sent at all.

On Wayland, use a compositor rule keyed on the app id instead. For KDE
Plasma, a KWin window rule matching window class `dev.bosn.widget` can set
"Keep above", "Skip taskbar", "Skip switcher", "No titlebar and frame" and
the position. A layer-shell anchored widget is a separate, optional feature
(not built by default; #389).

### Handle operations

After an open, each operation reserves a hub operation under a dedicated
right, dispatches through the Wry window dispatcher, and completes once the
native event loop has processed it. A revoked or closed handle returns
`WebviewError::WindowClosed`, like every other operation on a stale
generation.

- `set_size(w, h)`: the same 1-16384 logical-pixel bound as the options,
  rejected before native effects otherwise.
- `set_position(x, y) -> BestEffort`: the same bound as `initial_position`.
  Returns `Unsupported` without sending anything on Wayland, `Requested`
  otherwise.
- `show()`, `hide()`: `hide` keeps the page alive and the handle valid.
  `show` re-asserts taskbar exclusion for a skip-taskbar window, because
  Windows re-adds a taskbar button on show.
- `focus()`: best effort; window managers may refuse focus stealing.
- `navigate(&WebviewUrlGrant)`: replaces the top-level page so a caller can
  reuse one window instead of opening duplicates. It needs its own hub right
  (separate from presentation, so resizing never implies navigating). The
  grant is an already validated HTTP(S) URL; the view keeps its navigation
  handler, incognito session, and the absence of IPC. A view opened with a
  page bootstrap accepts only a grant on its original origin and returns
  `RejectedNavigation` for any other, before native effects and without
  closing the view. `wait_until_loaded` afterwards waits for the navigated
  page.

### Per host

"Toolkit" means the request reaches the native toolkit; the compositor or
window manager can still refuse it.

| Request | Linux Wayland (GTK 3) | Linux X11 | Windows | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| app id | `xdg_toplevel` app id | `WM_CLASS` from GLib program name | process AppUserModelID (taskbar grouping) | ignored: the bundle id comes from `Info.plist` and cannot change at run time |
| `decorations(false)` | applied (GTK draws no CSD) | applied | applied | applied |
| `transparent(true)` | RGBA window and WebKit background | same, needs a compositing WM | layered window and WebView2 background | WKWebView background only; the NSWindow stays opaque (needs Tauri's `macos-private-api`) |
| `always_on_top(true)` | `Unsupported`; use a KWin rule | honoured by an EWMH window manager | `HWND_TOPMOST` | floating window level |
| `skip_taskbar(true)` | `Unsupported`; use a KWin rule | `_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR` | `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` (also off Alt+Tab) plus `ITaskbarList` tab removal, re-asserted on show | accessory activation policy: no Dock icon or menu bar, for the whole process until it exits |
| `initial_position` / `set_position` | `Unsupported`, not sent | applied; a WM may adjust | applied | applied |
| `set_size` | toolkit (see below) | applied | applied | applied |
| `show` / `hide` | applied (hide unmaps the toplevel) | applied | applied | applied |
| `focus` | the compositor may refuse | WM focus-stealing policy applies | foreground rules apply | applied |
| `navigate` | applied | applied | applied | applied |

On Linux the app id is used twice before GTK initializes: as the GTK
application id, which GTK registers on the D-Bus session bus, and as GLib's
process-wide program name, which is what GTK 3 actually sends as the Wayland
app id and uses for the X11 `WM_CLASS`. Run one process per app id. The host
owns the process's GTK event loop, so renaming the program affects only it.
On Windows the id is set as the explicit AppUserModelID before the event loop
starts; an id Windows refuses fails host creation.

### Evidence

The `widget` smoke scenario opens an undecorated, transparent, keep-above,
skip-taskbar window under an app id at an initial position. The loopback
server requires the no-IPC report from the page, and
`verify_window_options_for_test` reads back the host's evidence: on Linux the
GTK application id, program name, decoration, skip-taskbar hint, RGBA visual
and app-paintable state, and the WebKit background alpha; on Windows the
AppUserModelID and the tool-window extended style; on macOS the accessory
activation policy. The scenario then checks the initial position where the
display honours it, rejects an out-of-range resize and move, resizes, moves
(and requires `set_position` to report exactly what `window_support` said),
hides, shows, re-verifies taskbar exclusion, focuses, navigates the same view
to a second page (whose no-IPC report the server also requires) and waits for
it, closes, and requires that no semantic or native state remains.
Keep-above is required only on hosts without an X11 or Wayland display: a
bare Xvfb has no window manager to grant it, and Wayland compositors ignore
it. The stale-handle checks in `timeout`, `cancel`, and `window-close` also
require every handle operation, `set_position` and `navigate` included, to
return `WindowClosed`. CI runs the scenario on Linux (Xvfb), Windows
(WebView2) and macOS.

Verified by hand on NixOS with KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland (NVIDIA): the window
carries `xdg_toplevel.set_app_id("dev.kernal-api.smoke-widget")` and
`window_support` reports all three controls `Unsupported`. On that desktop,
both in the live session and in a private `kwin_wayland --virtual`, a GTK
window opened by the facade never receives a frame callback after its first
commit, so a later `set_size` is not applied; the same happens on `main`
before these controls, and with the plain `close` scenario. Size a Wayland
window at open until #390 is fixed. The X11 path (Xvfb) passes the whole
scenario.
