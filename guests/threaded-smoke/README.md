# Threaded Rust smoke guest

This is a standalone, source-only Rust 1.95 fixture for
`wasm32-wasip1-threads`. It is intentionally not a workspace member and has a
checked-in lockfile, but no Wasm binary or build output.

It imports `kernal-api:v1::kernel_yield` through the checked-in generated guest
crate, creates and joins two ordinary Rust
child threads, and exercises `Arc<AtomicU32>`, `Mutex`, `mpsc`, TLS, and a
deterministic `DashMap` result. It publishes that bounded result through a
versioned atomics-only record in the imported shared memory; the host locates
the initialized record privately, so no guest export is added. Its public
manifest is deliberately exact: no validation metadata or report export
expands the `threaded-rust-v1` admission surface. The root instance enters
`_start` once; each child instance enters
`wasi_thread_start(tid, arg)` once. It deliberately performs no output,
environment, filesystem, network, clock, or randomness operations.

Run `scripts/build-threaded-smoke.ps1` on Windows or
`scripts/build-threaded-smoke.sh` on Unix. Both scripts use Soldr's `rustup`
front end to provision `wasm32-wasip1-threads`, build into a temporary or
caller-managed target directory, and run the real artifact through the public
admission profile, then run the same artifact inside the killable worker.
The worker proof requires normal completion and zero final worker, protocol,
root, and shared-memory accounting counters. It has an eight-second execution
deadline, one-second termination grace, and ten-second outer containment bound.
The artifact-dependent test is ignored by ordinary test runs; both scripts
explicitly select it with `--ignored` and fail if either execution path fails.
Soldr 0.9.11 is the first locally verified release for this
path. The Bash entry point requires a writable `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and uses its
`kernal-api-threaded-smoke` subdirectory, which keeps it compatible with
Bosn's read-only source mount. The temporary guest build deliberately runs
with Soldr's cache disabled: it characterizes admission, not cross-target
cache materialization.

The guest's target configuration pins the bundled Wasm linker and explicitly
exports `kernal-api-run`; the build scripts select Soldr's default linker only
for that guest compilation so the ambient host-linker choice cannot alter the
closed artifact ABI.

The cache-disabled build avoids the cached cross-target materialization failure
tracked by [soldr#2919](https://github.com/zackees/soldr/issues/2919). Supplying
a direct artifact remains a diagnostic lane: it distinguishes source build
failure from closed-profile admission failure.

On 2026-09-12, both execution paths passed on native Linux x86-64 using:

```sh
CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target/threaded-proof" bash scripts/build-threaded-smoke.sh
```

This is Linux evidence only, not native Windows or macOS evidence for #28.
