//! Filesystem-change-notification primitive: watcher construction and event
//! classification.
//!
//! This is deliberately the *primitive* only. Debouncing, ignore-list
//! filtering, and cache-invalidation policy are product decisions that stay
//! with the application; this facade owns constructing a watcher for the
//! selected host and classifying what it reports.
//!
//! On Linux and macOS this privately adapts the upstream `notify` crate. On
//! Windows this privately implements `ReadDirectoryChangesW` watching rather
//! than depending on `notify` at all, because upstream `notify` 7.0.0 has two
//! failure modes that leave a Windows watcher looking alive while silently
//! reporting nothing further:
//!
//! 1. The completion routine firing with a zero byte count, which the
//!    Windows documentation defines as a change-notification buffer
//!    overflow: some events were lost, but the watch is still running.
//! 2. `ReadDirectoryChangesW` failing to re-issue after a completion, which
//!    kills the watch for that directory outright.
//!
//! Both are detected here and surfaced through [`RescanRequired`] rather than
//! dropped, so a caller that trusts its watcher -- such as a build cache
//! deciding whether a cached artifact is still valid -- never trusts a stale
//! view of the filesystem without knowing it. See
//! `src/platform_win/fs_watch.rs` for the implementation and the exact
//! rationale carried alongside each fix.
