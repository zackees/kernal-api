//! macOS half of the external webview's window presentation.
//!
//! A macOS application id is the bundle identifier, fixed by `Info.plist`
//! for a bundled app and absent for a bare executable; it cannot be changed
//! at run time, so a validated app id is accepted and not applied here.
//! Keep-above is tao's floating window level. Taskbar exclusion has no
//! per-window form: it switches the application to the accessory activation
//! policy (no Dock icon, no menu bar). A transparent NSWindow needs Tauri's
//! `macos-private-api` feature, which this crate does not enable; only the
//! WKWebView background is made transparent.
