//! Facade-owned broker client: backend connect and refusal classification.
//!
//! The broker implementation stays in the private `running-process` backend.
//! This module is the adapter an application uses instead of naming it: an
//! owned request, an owned connection that is an ordinary `std::io` stream,
//! and owned route, refusal-code, refusal-kind, and error values. Backend
//! errors convert privately, so an application branches on *why* a broker
//! declined without compiling against the backend's types.
//!
//! [`connect_backend`](crate::broker_client::connect_backend) is blocking.
//! Async callers run it on a blocking worker. Endpoint naming, the product payload protocol spoken over the returned
//! connection, and every fallback decision remain application policy.
